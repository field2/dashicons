Dashicons version 2
=========

This is a fork of Dashicons (https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/)

This repositiory  contains an svg file for each dashicon. All fonts, css, and source files have been removed.
The purpose of this fork is to update Dashicons to a more flexible 24px grid base, and to remove, redesign, and add new icons as needed.
